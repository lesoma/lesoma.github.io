Introduction:
    I am a 25 years old entrant, who is into technology, cars and any kind of sport. I have a can do mentality, which probably comes from coding,
    where questions with answers like "it is impossible" do not exists. For me it is important to have knowledge in several fields to
    make me feel successful. I always keep my eye on recent consumer technologies, whether it is connected to phones, vehicles or any useful gadgets.
    It is amazing to see how they affect our everyday lives.


Education:
    I graduated in 2021 from Budapest Business School as an economist. However I was always interested in software developement,
    so I decided to give it a go with a basic frontend course. I really liked it, and I got a great opportunity to learn Java backend
    at GreenFox Academy. I felt like I want to deepen my knowledge in both frontend and backend developement to become a full stack developer.
    For that reason I started a complete wed developement course on Udemy.

Hobbies:
    I have two main hobbies, one of them is coding. I enjoy creating small projects, but I also like doing basic algoritmic
    problems on Leetcode. I really want to improve that skill, not just to write workable codes, but write quality ones. The other relaxing
    activity I frequently do is wall climbing. It is really fun to figure out how to absolve different routes, a great way to clear my mind
    and last but not least it is a suberb social activity.
